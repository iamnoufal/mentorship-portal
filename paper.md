# Summary

The current education system often lacks a structured and effective mentorship program, leaving many students without the guidance and support they need to succeed. This gap in mentorship can be particularly challenging for junior and pre-final year students who are navigating important academic and career decisions. Without access to experienced mentors, these students may struggle to make informed choices about their future paths, leading to missed opportunities and potential setbacks.

MentorHub aims to address this critical issue by providing a dedicated mentorship portal where final and pre-final year students can sign up as mentors, and junior students can choose their mentors based on their interests, career goals, and areas of expertise. By creating a platform that facilitates these meaningful connections, MentorHub seeks to empower students to make informed decisions about their academic and professional pursuits, ultimately leading to greater success and satisfaction in their chosen fields.

# Statement of need

The lack of a structured mentorship program not only hinders the personal and professional development of students but also contributes to a disconnect between academic learning and real-world application. MentorHub recognizes the importance of bridging this gap by connecting students with mentors who can offer practical insights, advice, and support. Through this platform, students can gain valuable knowledge and guidance that can help them navigate challenges, explore career options, and make informed decisions about their future.

By providing a platform for mentorship, MentorHub aims to create a supportive and collaborative community where students can learn from each other's experiences, share knowledge, and build meaningful connections that can last a lifetime. This initiative has the potential to not only benefit individual students but also contribute to a more vibrant and engaged academic environment, ultimately leading to a more successful and fulfilled student body.
